# dnd-charter-site

This is a local site to manage a Dnd Charter easily

My current plan
1. Create the look of the site, and have a place to put all the info with the charter
2. Create a script to read a fillable dnd 5e charter sheet to pull data and put it in the site
3. Add edit functions for the charter, and resave them in the fillable charter sheet
