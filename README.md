# dnd-character-site

This is a local site to manage a Dnd character easily

My current plan
1. Create the look of the site, and have a place to put all the info with the character
2. Create a script to read a fillable dnd 5e character sheet to pull data and put it in the site
3. Add edit functions for the character, and resave them in the fillable character sheet
